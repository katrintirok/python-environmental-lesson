## Creating variables in python

You can get output from python simply by typing math in the console:

```
3 + 5
12 / 7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign values to _variables_ (or link _objects_ to names/variables). A _variable_ is just a name for a value. Python's _variables_ must begin with a letter and are case sensitive. To create a variable, we need to give it a name followed by an `=` and the value we want to give it:

```
weight_kg = 55
```

`=` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to variables/names on the left. So, after executing `x = 3`, the value of `x` is `3`. Assignments can be done on more than one variable "simultaneously" on the same line like this:

```
a, b = 3, 4
```

Variables can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. You want your variable names to be explicit and not too long. They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2` is). Python is case sensitive (e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`). There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in python (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`,
see [here](https://docs.python.org/2.5/ref/keywords.html) for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use other function names (e.g., `list`, `mean`, `data`, `len`). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use. It's also not allowd to use a dot or minus (`.`, `-`) within a variable name as in `my.dataset` or `my-dataset`. 
It is also recommended to use _nouns_ for variable names, and _verbs_ for function names. It's important to be consistent in the styling of your
code (where you put spaces, how you name variables, etc.). A speciality of python is [indentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation), which is used to define code blocks and consequently structures a program. While this is generally a good style for program code, in the case of python, it is a language requirement. Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. There are several style guides for python, e.g. [python's PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), and [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/). 

Just remember how we assigned a value to `weight_kg`:

```
weight_kg = 55
```

Now that python has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. We can perform mathematical calculations in python using the basic operators
 `+, -, /, *, %` (plus, subtract, divide, multiply and modulus). For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new one:

```
weight_kg = 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of other variables.  For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new variable, `weight_lb`:

```
weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```
weight_kg = 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 220?

## Comments

The comment character in python is `#`, anything to the right of a `#` in a script will be ignored by python. It is useful to leave notes, and explanations in your scripts.
Spyder makes it easy to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the lines you  want to comment press at the same time <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on a Mac) and <kbd>1</kbd>. If you only want to comment out one line, you can put the cursor at any location of that line (i.e. no need to select the whole line), then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>.

## Objects vs. variables

Everything in python is an `object`: numbers, lists, functions, even code. A `variable`, as we use the term in Python, is a *way to access* a specific object. It is a binding between a name and an object. 

In python, every object has an ID, a type, and a value. The ID is a unique identifier that identifies a particular instance of an object, the type identifies the class (e.g. integer, string, list) of an object, and the value is the contents of the object. Mutable objects can change their value; immutable objects cannot.

## Functions and their arguments

Functions are "canned scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be made available by importing python *modules* (more on that later). A function usually gets one or more inputs called *arguments*. Functions often (but not always) return a *value*. A typical example would be the function `abs()`. The input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the output) is the absolute value of that number. Executing a function ('running it') is called *calling* the function. An example of a function call is:

```
a = -9
b = abs(a)
```

Here, the value of `a` (-9) is given to the `abs()` function, the `abs()` function calculates the absolute value, and returns the value which is then assigned to variable `b`. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.

The return 'value' of a function need not be numerical (like that of `abs()`), and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into python.

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value: these are called *options*. Options are typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether it ignores 'bad values', or what symbol to use in a plot.  However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice which will be used instead of the default.

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```
round(3.14159)
```

Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has returned the value `3`.  That's because the default is to round to the nearest whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting information about the `round` function.  We can look at the help for this function using `help(round)`.

```
help(round)
```

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type `ndigits=2` or however many we want.

```
round(3.14159, ndigits = 2)
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you don't have to name them:

```
round(3.14159, 2)
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

```
round(ndigits = 2, number = 3.14159)
```

It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're
rounding) first in your function call, and to specify the names of all optional arguments.  If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up the definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're doing.

### Using modules and external libraries with python

The always available [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) in python are limited. To get to use more functions for e.g. mathematical operations, *modules* can be used. A module in python contains a set of tools, the functions, that perform tasks on our data. There are a couple of modules that come with the [python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/index.html) including for example the `math` module, which provides access to mathematical functions and the `statistics` module for calculations of mathematical statistics.

Modules need to be imported using `import` and their functions can then be used by calling the name of the function together with the module name using the syntax `module_name.function_name`. Adding the module name with a `.` before the function name tells python where to find the function. 
For example the function `sqrt` is part of the module `math` and can be called using `math.sqrt()`:

```
import math
math.sqrt(9)
```

To find out more about an imported module use `help(module)` and to simply show a list of all functions use `dir(module)`, e.g. `dir(math)`.

A big advantage of python is its expandability with external modules (or libraries/packages). Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project.
Once a library is set up, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.

In this workshop we will make use of `numPy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` which are all part of the [SciPy ecosystem](https://scipy.org).

When importing libraries we can give them a nickname to shorten the command, e.g. `np` is commonly used as a nickname for the `numpy` module:

```
import numpy as np
np.cos(3.14159)
```

In the example above, we have imported numPy as np. This means we don't have to type out `numpy` each time we call a numPy function. `np.cos` calculates the cosine.

> 1. Import numpy, try the function `.pi` to represent the number $\pi$. 
> 2. Calculate the sine and cosine of `$\pi$`. 
> 3. What do `.floor` and `.ceil` do?
{: .challenge}

## Data types

There are two main types of data that we're exploring in
this lesson: numeric and text data types.

Numeric data types include integers (`int`) and floating point real values (`float`). 
A **floating point** number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For example: 1.13, 2.0, 1234.345. An **integer** will never have a decimal point. Thus if we wanted to store 1.13 as an integer it would be stored as 1. Similarly, 1234.345 would be stored as 1234. You will often see the data type `Int64` in python which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64
simply refers to the memory allocated to store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits it can store in each "cell". Allocating space ahead of time allows computers to optimize storage and processing efficiency. 

Text data type is known as *strings* (`str`) in Python. Strings can contain characters and/or numbers. For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several sentences. You can't perform mathematical calculations on a string, even if the string contains numbers. Strings are represented as a sequence of Unicode characters (in the range of U+0000 - U+10FFFF) in Python 3.x and thus are often show as `<U..`, e.g. `<U15`.

Another important data type are booleans (`bool`), i.e. `True` and `False`. Booleans represent the truth values of logic and are useful in conditional expressions, and anywhere else you want to represent the truth or falsity of some condition. `True` and `False` are stored as `1` and `0` in python.

> `a = 2`, `b = 4.5`, `c = "cat"`, `d = int(4.5)`, `e = float(3)`, `f=bool(true)`, `g=bool(0)`
> * Use the function `type()` to find which data type each variable corresponds to. 
> As you have seen, we can convert a floating point number to an integer or an integer to a floating point number. Notice that Python by default rounds down when it converts from floating point to integer.

	a = 7.83
	int(a)

```

### Data structures
#### Lists
Data structures represent data types that can contain more than one value. Lists are the most versatile of python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). For example we can create a list of animal weights and assign it to a new variable `weight_g`:

```
weight_g = [50, 60, 65, 82]
weight_g
```

A list can also contain strings:

```
animals = ["mouse", "rat", "dog"]
animals
```

The quotes around "mouse", "rat", etc. are essential here. Without the quotes python will assume there are variables called `mouse`, `rat` and `dog`. As these variables don't exist in python's memory, there will be an error message.

Lists in python can also hold items of different data type, i.e. a mix of numbers and strings:

```
streets = ["first", "second", "third", 1, 2, 3]
streets
```

You can use functions with lists, e.g. to get the number of elements in a list, i.e. its length, use `len()`:

```
len(animals)
```

The function `type` indicates the class of a variable, in this case a `list`:

```
type(animals)
```

#### Methods
Objects in python can have `methods`, which allow for changes (mutations) of the object. They are like object specific functions, that is they only work with e.g. `list`s or `int`s whereas normal functions are more general. We call `object methods` by adding the `method` to the `object` using a `.`. For example, you can use the `append()` method to add other values to the end of your list:

```
weight_g.append(90)    # adds 90 to the end of the list
weight_g
[50, 60, 65, 82, 90]
```

or use the `remove()` method to delete the first occurrence of an object from the list:

```
animals.remove("rat")
animals
["mouse", "dog"]
```

When typing `list.` and then using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key a window pops up with all available methods for lists. You can also use `help(list)` or `dir(list)` to get an overview of all methods for lists.

Other built-in data types in python are [`tuples`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=tuple#tuples-and-sequences) and [`dictionaries`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=tuple#dictionaries).

#### Numpy arrays
As described earlier, external libraries or modules largely extend the functionality of python and they also provide more data structures. In this workshop we will use **numpy arrays** (defined with `np.array`) and **pandas dataframes** (we will discuss those in the next episode).

NumPy arrays are multidimensional containers of items of the same type. That is, unlike lists, numpy arrays can only contain e.g. integers/floats or strings, but not both. They allow us to perform batch operations on data without any `for` loops (we will discuss loops in episode 5). This is called _vectorization_ and is something that is not possible on python's lists.

> ## Challenge - lists and numpy arrays
> Create a list, l1, with numbers 2,4,6,8 and another list, l2,  with letters a,b,c,d. Create two numpy arrays, a1 and a2, with the same content as l1 and l2. Then do the following operations (you will get ERROR messages for some of the operations!):
> 1. multiply l1, l2, a1, and a2 by 2
> 2. add 2 to l1, l2, a1, and a2
> 3. divide l1, l2, a1, and a2 by 2
> 4. try `l1 + l2`, `a1 + a2`, `l1 + a1`, `l2 + a1`
> 
> Discuss the different behaviour of lists and numpy arrays with your neighbour.

<!-- Another very useful data structure when working with data in python is a DataFrame from the pandas module. A DataFrame more or less represents a table, i.e. it has columns, with column headers and rows representing observations. A column needs to be of the same data type, i.e. either numeric or character, but different columns can differ in their data type. That means, pandas DataFrames are ideal to hold observational data tables imported into python. We will use DataFrames in the next episode.

## Subsetting lists and arrays in python

If we want to extract one or several values from a list, we must provide one or several indices in square brackets. The indices represent the position of the value in our list. For instance:

```
animals = ["mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat"]
animals[0]
```

Python indices start at 0, that is if you want to access the first element of `animals` you need to type `animals[0]`. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that's simpler for computers to do.
Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do.

Now that we have learned how to write scripts, and the basics of python's data structures, we are ready to start working with a real dataset, and learn about data frames.
